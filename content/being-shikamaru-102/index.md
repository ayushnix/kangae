Ughh. Great. What's the point in setting the alarm if I'm going to wake up before it goes off? What
a total waste. Now I've gotta shut it off but I don't feel like moving. But if I don't shut it off
it will just keep ringing and ringing. It makes me tired just thinking about the whole thing. Some
mornings are such a drag â€¦

Here's a wise quote with a citation but without an author

{% quote(citation="Shingeki no Kyojin, Volume 24, Chapter 97") %}
Every day I'm here, I think: Why did it ever come to this? Damaged minds and bodies ... their freedom taken away ... even losing themselves. If people knew it would come to this, nobody would go to war. But most people are pushed by something, forced to march into hell. That "something" wasn't their choice. Their situation or others made them do it. But people who push their own backs see a different kind of hell. They can see something beyond the hell. It might be hope. It may even be another hell. Only those who keep moving forward will ever know.

Here's a wise quote with a citation and the name of the author

{% quote(citation="Mass Effect 3", author="Javik") %}

And that's all folks!
