Ughh. Great. What's the point in setting the alarm if I'm going to wake up before it goes off? What
a total waste. Now I've gotta shut it off but I don't feel like moving. But if I don't shut it off
it will just keep ringing and ringing. It makes me tired just thinking about the whole thing. Some
mornings are such a drag â€¦
