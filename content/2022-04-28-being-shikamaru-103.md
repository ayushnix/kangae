Laziness is the mother of all bad habits, but ultimately she is a mother and we should respect her.

In fact, I've respected her right now by omitting both the title and the date in the markdown file
for this post.

*but ... but ... that's not right*

Oh, stop complaining, Zola will pick up the date from the filename.

*The title?*

Well, let's just forget about it.

*If you won't specify the title, the `discuss on github` link won't be shown*

Meh, who cares about that anyways.

*What about the tags?*

Yeah, let's skip those as well. What a drag ... {{ kaomoji(label="shrug kaomoji", text="╮( ˘_˘ )╭") }}
